This is my fullstack application. Basically, I designed a mini website that introduces the Straw Hat crew from the anime “One Piece.” The website’s data, which consists of all the crew members’ information (including names, images, descriptions, and signature skills), is stored in Firebase Firestore. The frontend is built with Next.js, taking advantage of React’s component-based architecture, while Firebase acts as a serverless backend to manage and host the database.

In this code, I utilize a page.js file that fetches data from the Firestore collection named “crewMembers” through asynchronous calls via the Firebase SDK. I import the necessary functions like getFirestore, collection, and getDocs from “firebase/firestore” to retrieve data. Once the data is fetched, it’s stored in a React state (useState), ensuring that as soon as the call completes, the UI automatically updates with the latest information. This dynamic approach eliminates the need to hardcode the Straw Hat crew’s details, allowing for easier maintenance and expansions—should I want to add more characters or edit existing ones in the future.

In terms of styling, I use page.module.css (a CSS Module) to define classes that keep the layout visually appealing and manageable. A 3D flip-card effect is employed to reveal extra details, such as each pirate’s signature skill, when the user hovers over the card. The global styles (in global.css) define root-level CSS variables—like background and foreground colors—allowing for consistent theming throughout the application. This separation of global and modular CSS helps keep the code clean and modular, making it easier to maintain and scale. Meanwhile, the configuration in next.config.js (or .mjs if using ESM) ensures that my application can fetch remote images from domains like Wikia or Wikimedia. I updated the default images property with remotePatterns to accommodate the external images for the crew’s portraits, solving any CORS or domain resolution issues that can arise with Next.js’ Image Optimization. If any image links go down or break, they can simply be replaced either by new external links or by uploading them to Firebase Storage.

As for Firebase, I rely on initializeApp to bootstrap my project’s settings, and then getFirestore to connect my application to Firestore. When the user visits the page, useEffect triggers a function to fetch all documents in the “crewMembers” collection. Each document is mapped to a JavaScript object containing fields such as name, image link, description, and skill. These objects are subsequently rendered as interactive flip cards. I also reference and display the images using Next.js’ <Image> component, which optimizes them for performance.

Ultimately, this setup demonstrates a complete, minimal fullstack flow: The front end in Next.js uses React for a dynamic UI, styles are managed in CSS Modules and global variables, and the data is persisted in Firebase Firestore. Adding or removing characters is straightforward—just update the Firestore collection, and the UI automatically reflects the changes. This design is highly extensible: I could integrate user authentication, real-time listeners, or more advanced backend logic if desired, making it a strong foundation for a modern web application.

Known Bugs
I’m aware that some of my images do not load correctly. I tried uploading them to my own Firebase Storage so I could have more reliable hosting, but that process requires switching to a paid plan, so I decided not to proceed at this time.

I created this project for my fullstack application. I learned everything by referencing the 24fall bootcamp PPT and handouts, combined with ChatGPT to troubleshoot numerous issues. I also encountered difficulties connecting to MongoDB, among other problems, but working through these challenges gave me a better understanding of the terminal, frontend, backend, and the overall process of building a website. I know this project is far from perfect, but I truly hope the fullstack program can give me an opportunity to continue learning in this field. I promise that I will devote most of my time to improving my skills and contributing to the group as best I can.
